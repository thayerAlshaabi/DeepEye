## Introduction
Our system works in a cycle. Our main class where the cycle starts is the **DrivingAssistant**, containing the main interface.  The main interface controls the next class in the cycle, the **ObjectClassifier**. It also contains the *warnings* function, which issues the driver warnings through artificial speech and/or visual cues. This function is dependent on the **ThreatClassifer** class, at the other end of the cycle.

## Architecture
Name | Description 
--- | ---
**driving_assistant** | This is the main class that controls all advanced driver-assistance systems. For more information please refer to [DrivingAssistant](driving_assistant/README.md).
**object_classifier** | This class is a deep convolutional neural network implemented using Tensorflow Object Detection API. For more information please refer to [ObjectClassifier](object_classifier/README.md).
**threat_classifer** | work in progress...
